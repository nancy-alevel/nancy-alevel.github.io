            <p class="descricao-delay">
            Climate change, the shortage of cheap clean energy and water resources not only threaten the survival of human civilization, but also threaten the sustainable social development and prosperity of the world. Nuclear energy is considered to be the future.<br></br>

            The aim of this project is to explore new research and development in the field of <a style = "color:blue;">nuclear fusion energy</a> and design an innovative Magetic-Inertial Confinement Fusion (MIF) Energy System.<br></br>

            <a style = "color:blue;">Coaxial plasma gun</a> is the key to this project and has been researched and developed for more than 70 years for a variety of applications, notably as a plasma thruster for space propulsion, creating a large and extensive physics and engineering knowledge base. 
            <br></br>

            As a research engineer (mechanical), I am responsible for designing and optimizing the plasma gun, conducting pratical experiments to test the feasibility and working performance of the gun, developing the <a style = "color:blue;">vacuum chamber system</a> of each experimental platform and carrying out <a style = "color:blue;">computational simulation</a> of the physics process and structurak analysis using USim and ANSYS. I am also involved in other physics experiments: Spark-gap switch, Argon Preionization, High energy density capacitors, etc.

            <h4 class="titulo-delay">Plasma Gun Design (Patent Application in progress)</h4>
            <p class="descricao-delay">
            The plasma gun, also known as an electromagnetic launcher, consists of three main sections: Gun electrode, Gas Valve and Main Capacitor Bank at the rear end. I am responsible for designing the <a style = "color:blue;">Gas Valve</a> and the <a style = "color:blue;">Gun electrodes</a>. <br></br>

            The Gas Valve is the key part of the gun. Its working principle is the use of an electromagnetic coil to drive the flyer plate up and down to realize opening and closing functions; in the meantime, a small amout of Argon gas is dispensed into the electrodes, followed by a pre-ionization, and then launched in the form of a plasma jet.<br></br>
            
            Under the supervision of Prof. Thio, I developed an <a style = "color:blue;">all-new gas valve design</a> for STG1. The original reciprocating valve is updated to an innovative <a style = "color:blue;">unidirectional valve</a>. This new design reduces the valve's opening time from <a style = "color:blue;">300μs</a> down to <a style = "color:blue;">150-200μs</a> based on simulation results and precise Laser Displacement Sensor (by KEYENCE) testing results.  <br></br>

            The first generation plasma gun was designed based on careful <a style = "color:blue;">production engineering</a> analysis.<br></br>

            • Material selection (Al2024, Titanium, Tungsten, Copper, Alumina ceramics, HDPE, PC, Teflon, Peek, etc.)<br></br>
            • Manufacturability<br></br>
            • Fabrication simplicity<br></br>
            • Machining processing methods<br></br>
            • Surface treatment (Anodic oxidation / Annealing)<br></br>
            • Machining accuracy<br></br>
            • Easy assembly     <br></br>      
            • Surface quality<br></br>
            • Cost performance<br></br>

            <p class="descricao-delay">
            Apart from the plasma gun development, I also designed and set up TWO vacuum chamber systems: one for Gun Development Platform; the other for Gas Valve & Pre-ionization Platform. They are now both in service. They provide an ultimate vacuum up to <a style = "color:blue;">10^(-7) torr</a>.<br></br>

            The two complete vacuum systems were all designed and developed <a style = "color:blue;">independently</a> by myself, including the main vacuum tank, quartz window, flanges, vacuum gauges (ionization gauge & Pirani gauge), feedthrough, vacuum pumps, digital control console, cooling water system, gas supply system, etc. <br></br>

              The first step is ideation, where I took time to think about what functionalities and features should be included, and what user experience should be like. With the goal of making people who don’t have professional music training have opportunities to experience a playful music-making process, <br>I decided to allow players manipulating the sound tracks.

              Before actually designing the UI, I sketched some drafts about the layout of the application. What I can confirm is that there should be five sliders to control the volume of each track; each track should have buttons to choose the sample sound; audio-visualizer is needed for creating a cool vibe.

            I did a preliminary user study, where I invited 10 of my friends to play with "More" Compiler. Most of they gave positive feedback and they stated that it is super fun to have more control of each track when listening to the music. I do believe that "interactive music experience" will be the trend in the future, since more engagement provides more engagement and give better music experience. <br></br> Through this project, the users can have a clear vision about how songs are composed because they can listen to different tracks separately, and then listen to all of them as a whole. However, this project mainly focused on recomposing "MORE", but not remixing it. In the future, we can try to remix the song by producing and creating different types of beats, changing the song to different speeds, and working out more suitable background music to suit the lyrics.
